# web_scrapping
This is a web scraping project where i scrapped the data from a website. i scrapped the median income from each country from the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income. 
For this i used the python libraries BeautifulSoup, Requests and Pandas. After scrapping all the data i put the all the data into a csv file.
